## Today
I met **Grayson**. He is **19 years old and has 6 snakes**:snake:. He keeps them in a "snake house" attached to the garage. He and his father are redesigning the enclosure for the large snake, Lakahesis, which is an 18 feet long [Reticulated python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_python). The names of his snakes are:
* Luna
* A-36
* Coco
* Violet
* Frosty
* Lakahesis

Grayson enojys playing video games and listening to music. He also has a cat named *Fisher* :cat:. Fisher is a larger cat who he believes to possibly be part maine coon.
